# Coding Guidelines and Best Practices

## 1. TypeScript & Type Safety

- Always define proper interfaces and types for all data structures
- Avoid using `any` type - use proper typing or `unknown` if type is truly uncertain
- Use TypeScript's strict mode (enabled in tsconfig.json)
- Utilize readonly properties when data shouldn't be modified

## 2. Component Structure

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Follow single responsibility principle
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper component folder structure:
  ```
  ComponentName/
  ├── ComponentName.tsx
  ├── ComponentName.styles.ts  (if using styled-components)
  ├── ComponentName.test.tsx
  └── index.ts
  ```

## 3. Naming Conventions

- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `ProductList.tsx`)
- Files: camelCase (e.g., `apiService.ts`)
- Functions: camelCase (e.g., `getUserData()`)
- Interfaces: PascalCase with 'I' prefix (e.g., `IProduct`)
- Types: PascalCase (e.g., `ProductType`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_ITEMS_PER_PAGE`)

## 4. State Management

- Use React Context for global state when needed
- Keep state as local as possible
- Avoid prop drilling - use composition or context instead
- Use proper state management hooks (useState, useReducer) appropriately

## 5. Code Organization

- Group related files in feature-based directories
- Keep business logic separate from UI components
- Use barrel exports (index.ts files) for cleaner imports
- Maintain clear separation of concerns

## 6. Error Handling

- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

## 7. Testing

- Write unit tests for all components and utilities
- Maintain minimum 70% code coverage
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Use meaningful test descriptions

## 8. Performance

- Implement proper memoization (useMemo, useCallback)
- Lazy load components when appropriate
- Optimize re-renders using React.memo
- Follow React performance best practices

## 9. API Integration

- Use service classes/modules for API calls
- Implement proper error handling for API requests
- Use environment variables for API configuration
- Cache API responses when appropriate

## 10. Documentation

- Document complex logic and business rules
- Add JSDoc comments for functions and components
- Keep README files up to date
- Document all environment variables and configuration

## 11. Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper ARIA labels
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Test with screen readers

## 12. Git Practices

- Write meaningful commit messages
- Use feature branches
- Follow conventional commits format
- Keep PRs focused and manageable in size

## 13. Code Style

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Remove unused imports and dead code
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## 14. Security

- Sanitize user inputs
- Implement proper authentication checks
- Avoid storing sensitive data in client-side storage
- Use HTTPS for all API calls

## 15. Dependencies

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Regularly audit packages for security issues
- Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies
- Document major dependency versions

Remember to follow these guidelines consistently throughout the project to maintain code quality and developer productivity.
